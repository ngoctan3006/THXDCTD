Alcohol-based hand sanitizers make a good substitute for hand-washing when soap and water is not available. 
A recent study from the University of Chicago showed that while soap-and-water hand-washing was most effective 
in removing influenza virus from the hands, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer was a close second. 
If you're using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, apply product to one palm, rub your two hands together, making sure 
to reach all surfaces, and continue rubbing until hands are dry.
